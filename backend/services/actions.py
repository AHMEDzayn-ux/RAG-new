"""
Transactional actions — the agent's "do things" tools, per-domain (mock-first).

An action is just a TOOL we hand the LLM: a name + description + JSON parameter
schema (same shape as `search_knowledge_base` / `escalate_to_human`). The agent
decides when to call one and collects the arguments conversationally. This module:

  - declares the per-domain tool set        -> get_action_tools(domain)
  - executes a called tool by its KIND      -> execute_action(...)

Every tool maps to one of four generic KINDS, so adding a domain/action is data,
not new execution code:

  ticket          -> log a request, return a reference number
  callback        -> log a callback request, return a reference
  account_lookup  -> read a (mock) account, return its details   (read-only, not recorded)
  account_change  -> update a (mock) account, return confirmation (recorded)

MOCK-FIRST: account handlers read/write the seeded `MockAccount` table. Swap a
handler body for a real API call to go live — nothing else changes.
