"""
Domain Templates — the "divertable across domains" core of the framework.

Each template is a reusable preset for a vertical (telecom, university, ...).
Creating a client = picking a domain; its persona/branding/normalization
context auto-fill from the template and remain overridable per client.

Adding a NEW vertical = adding one entry here. No pipeline code changes.
